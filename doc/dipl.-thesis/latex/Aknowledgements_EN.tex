\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

\noindent
First of all, I would like to thank my supervising professor, Prof. Konstantinos Tzafestas, for the trust he placed in me regarding this challenging yet fascinating topic in robotics. His support and guidance, often under difficult circumstances and time constraints, were of crucial importance for the successful completion of this work. \\

I would also like to particularly thank my parents, Panos and Zoi, whose moral and practical support throughout my years of study enabled me to remain fully focused on the learning process.
